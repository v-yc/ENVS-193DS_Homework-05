## General Information:

This study addresses the following research question: how do Sarracenia characteristics predict biomass?

The data package, "Effects of Prey Availability on Sarracenia Physiology at Harvard Forest 2005" was used for this study. It includes data on different characteristics of Sarracenia (pitcher plant) species, such as mass, chlorophyll content, potassium content, and nitrogen content, in 2005.

## Data and file overview:

There are 5 files in this package:

1. "knb-lter-hfr.109.18.report.xml" checks document validity.
2. "knb-lter-hfr.109.18.txt" contains the metadata on methods, variables, and dataset.
3. "knb-lter-hfr.109.18.xml" is the same as "knb-lter-ntl.6.34.txt" but in .xml format.
4. "manifest.txt" is the manifest file for the data package.
5. "hf109-01-sarracenia.csv" contains the sample data with 32 variables and 121 observations. The variables can be separated into these general categories: species, feed level, photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content, growth, architecture, and foliar nutrient levels.
